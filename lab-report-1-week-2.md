## 2. Remotely Connecting
Install [OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse), then look up your course-specific account at the [UCSD account lookup page](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). All accounts for this course will begin with `cs15lwi22` followed by three letters; mine are `aho`. Using a terminal of your preference, input the command `$ ssh cs15lwi22aho@ieng6.ucsd.edu` with the three letters of your account replacing those of mine. Upon successfully connecting, the following should be displayed:
